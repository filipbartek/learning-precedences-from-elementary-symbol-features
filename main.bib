abstract="A term is an individual constant or variable or an n-adic function letter followed by n terms. An atomic formula is an n-adic predicate letter followed by n terms. A literal is an atomic formula or the negation thereof. A clause is a set of literals and is thought of as representing the universally-quantified disjunction of its members. It will sometimes be notationally convenient1 to distinguish between the empty clause □, viewed as a clause, and `other' empty sets such as the empty set of clauses, even though all these empty sets are the same set-theoretic object {\o}. A ground clause (term, literal) is one with no variables. A clause C' (literal, term) is an instance of another clause C (literal, term) if there is a uniform replacement of the variables in C by terms that transform C into C'.",

For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator {\textperiodcentered}, the unary operator −, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a {\textperiodcentered} (b {\textperiodcentered} c) = (a {\textperiodcentered} b) {\textperiodcentered} c, a {\textperiodcentered} a− = e, a {\textperiodcentered} e = a, the laws a− {\textperiodcentered} a = e, e {\textperiodcentered} a = a, a− −= a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a {\textperiodcentered} b = b {\textperiodcentered} a−is not a consequence of the given axioms.},
