abstract="A term is an individual constant or variable or an n-adic function letter followed by n terms. An atomic formula is an n-adic predicate letter followed by n terms. A literal is an atomic formula or the negation thereof. A clause is a set of literals and is thought of as representing the universally-quantified disjunction of its members. It will sometimes be notationally convenient1 to distinguish between the empty clause □, viewed as a clause, and `other' empty sets such as the empty set of clauses, even though all these empty sets are the same set-theoretic object {\o}. A ground clause (term, literal) is one with no variables. A clause C' (literal, term) is an instance of another clause C (literal, term) if there is a uniform replacement of the variables in C by terms that transform C into C'.",

We discuss the superposition calculus and explain the key concepts of saturation and redundancy elimination, present saturation algorithms and preprocessing, and demonstrate how these concepts are implemented in Vampire. Further, we also cover more recent topics and features of Vampire designed for advanced applications, including satisfiability checking, theory reasoning, interpolation, consequence elimination, and program analysis.},

  abstract      = {An algorithm is described which is capable of solving certain word problems: i.e. of deciding whether or not two words composed of variables and operators can be proved equal as a consequence of a given set of identities satisfied by the operators. Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator {\textperiodcentered}, the unary operator −, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a {\textperiodcentered} (b {\textperiodcentered} c) = (a {\textperiodcentered} b) {\textperiodcentered} c, a {\textperiodcentered} a− = e, a {\textperiodcentered} e = a, the laws a− {\textperiodcentered} a = e, e {\textperiodcentered} a = a, a− −= a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a {\textperiodcentered} b = b {\textperiodcentered} a−is not a consequence of the given axioms.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
